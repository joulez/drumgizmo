Installation Instructions

Compiling and installing the LV2 plugin
=======================================
If you extracted the code from a tar-ball skip to the "Configuring" section.

Preparing code from git
-----------------------
If you cloned the repository from git, make sure to run the following commands
in order to obtain the hugin debug code:
 git submodule init
 git submodule update

After that you need to run ./autogen.sh

Configuring
-----------
Run ./configure --enable-lv2 --prefix=/usr
Then run 'make && make install' and the plugin should be installed in
/usr/lib/lv2/drumgizmo.lv2
If you want to compile only the LV2 parts of the plugin use
'--disable-editor --disable-cli' as additional parameters to the configure
script.

The LV2 plugin requires the following dependencies:
pkg-config >= 0.23
lv2 >= 1.0
Xlib >= 1.0
sndfile >= 1.0.21
libpng >= 1.2
pthread (no minimal version specified)
expat (no minimal version specified)

Be aware that if you are planning on running the LV2 plugin from within one
of the binary releases of Ardour, you must make sure that drumgizmo is using
the same version of libpng, pthread and expat as Ardour was compiled with (or
at least versions matching the ABI), otherwise the plugin will show strange
behaviour or even crash upon load.
